### **1. What is Git? (The Concept)** [Lien](https://youtu.be/fDkR0TDR9dI)

Git is a "Version Control System." Think of it as a **Time Machine** for code.

- **For Developers:** It saves every version of a project so you never lose work and can collaborate with others.
    
- **For Hackers:** Because it saves _everything_, it remembers mistakes (like deleted passwords) forever. This makes it a primary target.

### **2. The Developer's View: How to Use It**

To hack Git, you must first understand how files move through it. There are three specific "zones" where a file can exist:

#### **The "Save" Cycle (Your Daily Routine)**

1. **Working Directory:** You create or edit a file here. It is not saved in Git yet.
    
2. **Staging Area:** You select this file to be prepared for the next snapshot.
    
    - _Command:_ `git add filename`
        
3. **Repository:** You take a permanent snapshot of the Staging Area.
    
    - _Command:_ `git commit -m "Saved work"`
        

#### **Essential Commands Cheat Sheet**

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**`git clone <url>`**|Downloads a repository from the internet to your machine.|
|**`git status`**|**Most Important.** Tells you which files are changed, staged, or untracked.|
|**`git add .`**|Moves **all** changed files to the Staging Area.|
|**`git commit -m "msg"`**|Saves the snapshot permanently to the history.|
|**`git push`**|Uploads your commits to a server (like GitHub).|
|**`git branch`**|Lists different versions (branches) of the code.|

### **3. The Hacker's View: How to Exploit It**

In CTFs (like Bandit Level 27-31), you are looking for **human error**. Developers often accidentally commit passwords, realize their mistake, delete the password, and commit again. They think it's gone. **It is not.**

#### **Vulnerability A: The "Time Machine" Attack**

You can dig into the past to find "deleted" secrets.

- **`git log`**: Shows the list of all past "snapshots" (commits).
    
- **`git log -p`** (**The CTF Killer Command**): This shows the log **AND** the actual changes (diffs) made in each step.
    
    - _What you look for:_ Lines starting with a red minus sign (`-`) indicating text that was removed.
        
    - _Example:_
        
        Diff
        
        ```
        - password = "SuperSecretPassword123"  <-- You found the flag!
        + password = "*****"
        ```
        
- **`git show <commit_id>`**: Lets you jump back to a specific moment in time to read a file as it existed back then.
    

#### **Vulnerability B: Hidden Locations (Branches & Tags)**

Sometimes the secret isn't in the main history, but hidden in a parallel version of the code.

- **`git branch -a`**: Lists **all** branches (including hidden remote ones). If you see a branch named `dev`, `feature/login`, or `debug`, switch to it immediately!
    
    - _Command:_ `git switch <branch_name>`
        
- **`git tag`**: Lists "tags" (labels for specific versions, like v1.0, v2.0). Sometimes a flag is hidden in an old tag.
    
    - _Command:_ `git checkout <tag_name>`
        

#### **Vulnerability C: Exposed `.git` (Web Hacking)**

If a website administrator accidentally uploads the hidden `.git` folder to their public web server, you can download the entire source code of their site using tools like `git-dumper`, even if they didn't intend to share it.

### **Summary for Bandit (Levels 27 → 31)**

You are about to start the "Git" block of Bandit. Here is your battle plan:

1. **Clone the repo:** You will be given a specific SSH URL and port. Use `git clone ssh://...` to bring the challenge to your `/tmp` folder.
    
2. **Check `README`:** Usually the first clue.
    
3. **Check `git log -p`:** Look for "deleted" passwords in the history.
    
4. **Check `git branch -a`:** Look for hidden branches.
    
5. **Check `git tag`:** Look for hidden version tags.
